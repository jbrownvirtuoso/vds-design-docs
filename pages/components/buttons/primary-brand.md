# Primary Brand Buttons

Here is a basic example of a Primary Button. Buttons can be customized with several props to change the size, add an icon, etc.


Primary Buttons are high emphasis. Use once per screen to draw attention to the highest priority action. Multiple primary buttons make it confusing for the user to understand what action they should take. Not all screens require a Primary Button.


Primary Buttons have four sizes: `extraSmall`, `small`, `medium`, and `large`. Icons are supported for every size and can be positioned at the `start` or `end` with the `iconPosition` prop.
