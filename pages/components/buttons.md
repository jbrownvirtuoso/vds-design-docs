# Buttons (generally speaking)

Buttons are used to initialize an action. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

| Property | Value | Default value | Is required | Description |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| href | text |    | no | designates the button as anchor and applies the href attribute |
| isFullWidth | yes/no | no | no | extends the button to 100% width |
